# MongoDBStitch

This library lets your agent code to work with [MongoDB Stitch service](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/stitch).

This version of the library supports the following functionality:

- login to MongoDB Stitch using an application API key
- executing a Function

**To add this library to your project, add** `#require "MongoDBStitch.agent.lib.nut:1.0.0"` **to the top of your agent code.**

## Prerequisites

Before using the library you need to have:

- id of the Stitch application ([how to create a Stitch App](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/getting-started))
- API key of the Stitch application ([how to enable and configure API Key Authentication](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/auth/apikey-auth))
- (if your IMP application uses Functions) name(s) of the Function(s) and knowledge about their input parameters and response ([Functions overview](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/functions/))

## Library Usage

### Callbacks

All requests that are made to the MongoDB Stitch service occur asynchronously. Every method that sends a request has an optional parameter which takes a callback function that will be called when the operation is completed, successfully or not. The callbacksâ€™ parameters are listed in the corresponding method documentation, but every callback has at least one parameter, *error*. If *error* is `null`, the operation has been executed successfully. Otherwise, *error* is an instance of the [MongoDBStitchError](#mongodbstitcherror-class) class and contains the details of the error.

### MongoDBStitchError Class

Represents an error returned by the library and has the following public properties:

- *type* &mdash; The error type, which is one of the following *MONGO_DB_STITCH_ERROR* enum values:

  - *MONGO_DB_STITCH_ERROR.LIBRARY_ERROR* &mdash; The library is wrongly initialized, or a method is called with invalid argument(s), or an internal error. The error details can be found in the *details* property. Usually it indicates an issue during an application development which should be fixed during debugging and therefore should not occur after the application has been deployed.
  
  - *MONGO_DB_STITCH_ERROR.PUB_SUB_REQUEST_FAILED* &mdash; HTTP request to MongoDB Stitch service fails. The error details can be found in the *details*, *httpStatus* and *httpResponse* properties. This error may occur during the normal execution of an application. The application logic should process this error.
  
  - *MONGO_DB_STITCH_ERROR.PUB_SUB_UNEXPECTED_RESPONSE* &mdash; An unexpected response from MongoDB Stitch service. The error details can be found in the *details* and *httpResponse* properties.
  
- *details* &mdash; A string with human readable details of the error.

- *httpStatus* &mdash; An integer indicating the HTTP status code, or `null` if *type* is *MONGO_DB_STITCH_ERROR.LIBRARY_ERROR*

- *httpResponse* &mdash; A table of key-value strings holding the response body of the failed request, or `null` if *type* is *MONGO_DB_STITCH_ERROR.LIBRARY_ERROR*.

### MongoDBStitch Class

#### Constructor: MongoDBStitch(*appId*)

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *appId* | String | Yes  | The Stitch application's ID |

Returns *MongoDBStitch* instance created.

#### loginWithApiKey(*apiKey[, callback]*)

Login to the Stitch application using an API key. Authentication is required every time the library is restarted.

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *apiKey* | String | Yes | API key for the authentication |
| *callback* | Function | Optional | Executed once the operation is completed |

The method returns nothing. The result of the operation may be obtained via the *callback* function, which has the following parameters:

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *error* | MongoDBStitchError | Error details, or `null` if the operation succeeds |
| *response* | Table | Body of the HTTP response received from MongoDB Stitch service. Decoded from JSON. Key-value table, where key is a string, value is any type |

#### executeFunction(*name[, args][, callback]*)

Execute the specified Function. The Function should exist in the Stitch application.

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *name* | String | Yes | Name of the Function |
| *args* | Array of any type | Optional | Input parameters for the Function |
| *callback* | Function | Optional | Executed once the operation is completed |

The method returns nothing. The result of the operation may be obtained via the *callback* function, which has the following parameters:

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *error* | MongoDBStitchError | Error details, or `null` if the operation succeeds |
| *response* | Table | Body of the HTTP response received from MongoDB Stitch service. Decoded from JSON. Key-value table, where key is a string, value is any type |

#### setDebug(*value*)

This method enables (*value* = `true`) or disables (*value* = `false`) the library debug output (including error logging). It is disabled by default. The method returns nothing.
